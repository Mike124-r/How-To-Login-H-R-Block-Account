Why You Should Log In to Your H&R Block Account
You may use a lot of online tax services once you make an H&R Block account and sign in. These are:

Beginning and finishing your federal and state tax returns

Keeping and getting back old tax papers

Uploading forms safely for review

Making appointments with tax experts

Getting real-time updates on the status of your return

Using other H&R Block tools, such as calculators or return trackers

The account keeps everything in one place and easy to find, which saves time and cuts down on paperwork.

What to Get Ready Before Signing In
Make sure you have the following before you try to sign in to your H&R Block account:

Your username or email address that you used to sign up

The password you made for the account

Access to the email or phone number you used to sign up (for verification)

A safe connection to the internet

You can use a desktop or mobile browser or the H&R Block app.

If you've never logged in before, you'll need to sign up first by making an account with a working email address and a strong password.

How to Sign In: Step 1 Go to the H&R Block website.
Use the web browser of your choice to go to the H&R Block homepage. If you have a smartphone or tablet, you can also open the H&R Block app.

Step 2: Click on "Log In"
The "Sign In" button is in the top right corner of the screen. If you click this, you'll go to the page where you can log in.

Step 3: Type in your information
Enter the email address or login that is linked to your H&R Block account. Next, carefully type in your password. Check for capital letters or typos because passwords are case-sensitive.

Step 4: Finish Two-Step Verification (if it's turned on)
H&R Block will send you a code by email or text message if you have two-factor authentication turned on. Type in this code to prove who you are and move on.

Step 5: Get to Your Dashboard
After you log in, you'll be sent to your user dashboard. You can pick up where you left off on a saved tax return, start a new one, look at returns from prior years, change your account settings, or make an appointment here.

How to Reset Your Login Information
If you can't remember your login info:

Password Not Remembered: On the sign-in screen, click the link that says "Forgot Password?" You will get an email with steps to change your password.

If you forgot your username, click on the "Forgot Username?" link and follow the instructions to get it back.

Always use a password that is hard to guess and easy to remember, and maintain your recovery information up to current.

Common Problems with Logging In and How to Fix Them
Issue: The page won't load
Check your internet connection, clean your browser's cache, or try a new browser as a solution.

Issue: Login information not detected
Answer: Check that there are no mistakes in your typing. Resetting your password or username may help if the problem keeps happening.

Check your spam folder or ask for the code again to fix the problem. If it doesn't come, get in touch with H&R Block customer service.

Issue: Account locked because of too many failed attempts
Solution: Wait a few while before attempting again, or follow the steps to reset your login information.

How to Log In Safely
To keep your tax information safe:

Make sure your password is strong and unique.

Don't use public Wi-Fi to log in

Turn on two-factor authentication

Always log out after you're done.

Install the latest antivirus software on your device.

Your H&R Block account has private financial information, so it's a good idea to take extra steps to keep it safe from people who shouldn't have access to it.
